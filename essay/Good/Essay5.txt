“roSENcrANTz ANd GUILdENSTErN ArE dEAd” IS an astounding, intellectually challenging, and humorous concoction. Stoppard
cleverly captures the characters of Hamlet, written by Shakespeare, but
creates somewhat of a comic tragedy. Clearly an oxymoron, but profoundly effective. The play focuses on the story of Hamlet, but from the
viewpoint of rosencrantz and guildenstern, and it also takes the theories proposed in Hamlet and presents them in a comic, rather than sullen, manner. One of the most humorous scenes is when rosencrantz,
or guildenstern, since the distinction is never truly made between
the two, is laying on a table and thinking to himself what it is like
to be “dead in a box.” This scene proves to be hilarious, despite its
deep meaning, and parallels the infamous “To be, or not to be” speech
in Hamlet. Life’s unanswerable questions are constantly being asked
throughout the play, but by inserting these dubious inquiries within
a comedy, Stoppard is able to captivate and preserve his audience’s attention. In fact, the humor provides the wiring, which connects the 
messages of the play to our own chaotic existences. This brilliant literary work captures the essence of a tragedy within a comedy, something
only few authors can accomplish. It is able to provide profound, theoretical ideas that have long been questioned into a comic perspective,
and yet keep its integrity
